              Hi, I&apos;m Renanda
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
              Iâ€™m M.Renanda Firdhausa, a fresh graduate student in Informatics Engineering with a strong interest in game development. I love games and enjoy bringing ideas to life by creating experiences that captivate and delight players. During my studies, I have gained foundational skills in programming and software development. I am eager to apply these skills in real-world challenges and continuously learning new technologies and tools to grow as a developer. 
             </Typography>
              <Typography>
              I have developed several simple games mainly using Unity, which has allowed me to gain valuable practical experience in the game development process. My main focus is implementing interesting ideas into the main mechanics of the game through coding, as well as creating shaders and effects to enhance the visual quality and atmosphere of the game.
              In my final year, I also have experience in Virtual Reality by creating a VR application simulating the Siak Palace as part of my thesis project. This simulation allows users to explore the Siak Palace virtually, providing a realistic and immersive tour.
